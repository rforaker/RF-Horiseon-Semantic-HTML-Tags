# RF-Horiseon-Semantic-HTML-Tags

For this assignment, I took existing code and modified it to utilizize semantic HTML elements and descriptive "alt" image tags to increase accessibility. I also consolidated the CSS selectors and properties to be more efficient and use the minimum amount of space. Finally, I added comments to each CSS selector describing the functionailty of the properties that follow.

Note: I did use multiple commits for this project, however I had a ton of trouble getting the repo set up and ended having to start over from scratch and create a new repo, thus there is only one commit now.
